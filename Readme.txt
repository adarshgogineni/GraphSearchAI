Hello!

Welcome to our Mazerunner project. This file includes the instructions on how to run each of the five algorithms as well as the buring maze part of the project. The main file of this project is test.py. This file includes the meathods that call other files that have different algorithms written in it.You can run this file and it will run the basic algorithms with n=10 and prob = 0.2. You can also try to run the fire.py to see how we implemented fire and strategy1.py and strategy2.py to see the implementation of the two stratergies. 

We have also included all the CSV files that we generated to collect the data. The grphs are all included in the documentation. The document is also in this folder.
